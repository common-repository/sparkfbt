[SparkFBT Website](https://sparkplugins.com/sparkfbt) | [Demo](https://demo.sparkplugins.com/sparkfbt-demo) | [Support](https://sparkplugins.com/support) | [Documentation](https://sparkplugins.com/documentation)

### üëç Product Recommendations

Our SparkFBT Plugin for WooCommerce automatically calculates, based on actual order history &amp; customer purchasing habits of your webshop, what products to recommend (smart bundles to upsell or cross sell) for any particular product in your WooCommerce webshop.

### üé® Customization Options

By default, SparkFBT adds Frequently Bought Together Products in the identical style your WooCommerce template offers them, so you don&#039;t need to worry about the looks.

Want to customize the looks of the Frequently Bought Together Products on your website? Just go ahead and do so üòé. No coding skills required.

Did I mention that the products can also be inserted in a carousel (PRO) to become a slider?

### üìç You control the location(s) of the Frequently Bought Together Products

SparkFBT offers 3 WooCommerce positions to place a Frequently Bought Together section (Product Detail page, Cart page and Checkout page).

Besides these fixed positions also a shortcode is generated to place the product recommendations on any position you like.

Do you want several sections (PRO) showing your Frequently Bought Together Products throughout your website, perhaps with a different design, number of products, etc? We&#039;ve got you covered as well!

### üì± Responsive Design

The plugin is fully responsive, including the admin area, ensuring a seamless browsing and managing experience across all devices and screen sizes.

### üèÅ Next, Next, Finish

Build up your recommendations with the helpful wizard, which guides you through the process of creating a new product promotion.

### üìà What about analytics?

With SparkFBT, you have access to powerful analytics (PRO) that help you understand your customers&#039; preferences and behaviors. This valuable data empowers you to refine your marketing strategies and product recommendations, turning more visitors into satisfied customers and boosting conversion rates.
